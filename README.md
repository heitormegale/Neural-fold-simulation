# Neural fold simulation
Mechanical simulation of cell tissue

This code was implemented to simulate the mechanical properties of the neural fold observed in the manuscript “Self-organized morphogenesis of a human neural tube in vitro by geometric constraints” (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.24.453659v1)
